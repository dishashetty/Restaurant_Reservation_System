This restaurant was established in the year 1994 Nov’ 27.
The idea behind the establishment of this restaurant was to make the most fabulous and healthy INDIAN Food available all over the world.The Essence of Indian food is special in any country.<br><br>As the new era of the food world evolved,the old traditional food vanished .So, this restaurant brings the essence of healthy food that people used to like,in the olden days.<br><br>
As the name R@$0Y! that comes from a "Hindi" word,which means “kitchen”.<br>We assure that our food will remind you the taste of your Mother’s recepies.<br><br>We use the old fashion of cooking utensils and atmosphere in our kitchen because todays food is made by machines that eat away all the necessary/essential vitamins of the food leaving behind a plate of shit to eat.<br><br>To preserve the vitamins in the food ,we cook in the native Indian style.
